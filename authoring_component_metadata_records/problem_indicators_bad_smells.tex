\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Problem indicators (``bad
smells'')}{Problem indicators (bad smells)}}\label{problem-indicators-bad-smells}

As is the case for component and profile definitions, ``smells'' can
also be identified for metadata records. The patterns described in this
section serve as indicators for potential issues with the metadata at
hand. It can also be the case that a smell in a record is indicative of
an issue with the design of the profile it is based on, or its
constituent components, i.e.~a modelling issue. To identify a specific
``smell'' in a record does not necessarily mean that the metadata is
broken. Instead it should be seen as a warning sign that there may be a
problem which should be checked.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The record file is very large (several megabytes). A higher
  granularity may improve the usability of the metadata. Large
  collections records can be divided into subcollections. Non-collection
  records should only describe a single resource or a set of strongly
  related resources. In any case, be aware that large files are not
  ideal for processing by humans and machines.
\item
  There is no single title or description for the record as a whole. If
  the record can only be described using multiple titles, this indicates
  that the record should perhaps be split up into multiple records or
  perhaps a hierarchical collection. Of course, if a single title could
  be imagined but simply is missing, it should just be added.
\item
  The record contains very little information.: Sparseness can be a sign
  of assumed information `percolation'. In such cases, records `higher
  up' in the hierarchy may contain relevant information but this
  information is not included in the records that describe the actual
  data. The CMD infrastructure provides no mechanism for inferring
  information across hierarchy levels.
\item
  Many of the available fields are omitted or left empty. This could
  indicate that potentially relevant information is lacking from the
  description. Note that this could also be the result of a conscious
  decision, i.e.~an existing `broad' profile was chosen that fits the
  description but allows for additional information that is irrelevant
  in the particular use case.
\item
  Low ``information entropy''. If there are many highly similar files,
  this could be an indication that relevant, distinguishing information
  is lacking. If the used profile does not allow for richer
  descriptions, reconsider your choice of profile and/or modelling
  decisions.
\item
  Occurrence of multiple values in a single string. For example multiple
  element values separated by commas, semicolons or other characters. In
  general it is better to use repeating elements, or use separate
  elements if the individual values have different semantics (for
  example resource type ``English literature -- Middle English``).

\item
  Metadata content in multiple languages but no `xml:lang' attributes.
  It is highly recommended to provide multilingual metadata if
  applicable (for example original and translated titles, see
  \href{../common_approachesproblems/multilingual_metadata.md}{Multilingual
  metadata}). However when doing so, the elements concerned should be
  annotated with the \texttt{@xml:lang} attribute. If there are no such
  attributes, or another (custom) attribute is used to indicate the
  description language, use a profile (version) that allows for this
  attribute instead.
\item
  URLs or persistent identifiers (PIDs) in the payload. Online resources
  that are described through a metadata record or relate to it in
  another way are generally accommodated for by the Resource Proxies
  (see
  \href{/authoring_component_metadata_records/the_envelope.md\#e5}{E5}).
  In many cases URLs or PIDs such as handle URIs appearing in elements
  and attributes outside the envelope do in fact represent either a
  described resource, related metadata, landing page or search page and
  therefore should be embedded in a resource proxy. Exceptions are for
  example pointers to related literature, or web pages of projects,
  researchers, actors or organisations that are not landing pages for
  the described resource(s). Note that resource proxies can be referred
  to (using the \texttt{@cmd:ref} attribute) from any point in the
  record that is at the component level (see
  \href{/authoring_component_metadata_records/the_component_section.md\#cs2}{CS2}).
\item
  The only resource proxy is of type `Resource' but it points to a web
  page. Should probably be a landing page (see
  \href{/authoring_component_metadata_records/the_envelope.md\#e11}{E11}),
  `Resource' type proxies should lead to machine processable files.
