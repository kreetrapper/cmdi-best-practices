\subsection{Scope}\label{scope}

The target audience for the Best Practice guide includes 1) CMD
modellers who select or create components and profiles to describe
certain language resources, 2) developers who create metadata
converters, forms or editors to create records that comply with these
profiles, and 3) the group of CMD creators who create records ``by
hand'', i.e.~using no other tooling than an XML editor or even a plain
text editor. End users of the infrastructure are, in general, not
directly exposed to CMDI, but if so should be fully guided by a
user-friendly interface (with its own user guide) and shielded from the
technical details. Furthermore, using this Best Practice guide will
require a basic understanding of CMDI - it is not intended as a
tutorial.\footnote{For a tutorial, please refer to
  \url{https://www.clarin.eu/cmdi\#training}}

The CLARIN infrastructure can deal with any valid CMD record that is
based on a profile from its Component Registry. The technical
specification (CE-2016-0880) acts as the core reference with its
declarative definitions and examples of valid CMD profiles, components
and records. In contrast, the CMDI Best Practice guide is process
oriented and aims to guide the work involved in constructing valid and
high quality CMD components, profiles and records. The scope of the best
practices goes beyond those purely schematic constraints and ranges from
modelling guidelines, e.g. ``prefer elements over attributes'', to
rather low-level technical guidelines, e.g. ``use the UTF-8 encoding for
your CMD records''. In general, the CLARIN infrastructure will extract
information more efficiently from CMD records that meet these best
practices and, hence, provide the end users improved access to those
records, the context from which they originate and the resources they
provide.
