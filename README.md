# Introduction

In 2016, both version 1.2[^1] of the [Component Metadata](https://www.gitbook.com/book/clarin-eric/cmdi-best-practices/edit#) \(CMD\) Infrastructure \(CMDI\) and a first complete technical specification \(CE-2016-0880\) of this metadata standard were introduced. The new version introduced new possibilities, which have been gradually opened up by the ecosystem of tools and registries in CMDI. One of the key properties of CMDI is its flexibility, which makes it possible to create metadata records closely tailored to the requirements of resources and tool ctice guide. Hopefully this guide, together with the technical CMDI 1.2 specification, will be a valuable knowledge base and will help any \(technical\) CMDI user to bring her CMD records to their full potential use within [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu).
